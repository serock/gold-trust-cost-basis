# gold-trust-cost-basis
Create a LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet using data SPDR® Gold Trust ETF cost basis factors from a consolidated 1099 PDF tax form

## Overview
The main goal of the app is to calculate the cost basis for the SPDR® Gold Trust's monthly sales of gold that are reported on Form 1099-B.

The app pulls cost basis factor data from a consolidated 1099 PDF tax form into a LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet.
The app also creates an empty tax lots sheet to be populated by the user with info about the purchases and sales of the SPDR® Gold Trust ETF shares.
Using the tax lot info, the app adds a sheet that shows the cost of gold sold and the adjusted cost basis for each tax lot during each month and adds a sheet that summarizes the cost of gold sold each month.

## Installation Instructions
### Prerequisites
Before attempting to run the app, install the following software:

1. A build of OpenJDK 17 or higher, such as [Eclipse Temurin 17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17) or [Amazon Corretto 17](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/)
   * A JDK download can be used to build and/or run the app.
   * A JRE download is smaller and can be used to run the app, but not build it.
2. [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download-libreoffice/) (24.8.x is recommended)

### Option 1: Install a Build of the App
Builds of the app are available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

1. From the [Releases](/../../releases) page, download the `.tar.gz` or `.zip` distributable archive and the `.sha256` file for your operating system.
2. Verify the integrity of the downloaded archive (e.g., on Linux, run `sha256sum -c gold-trust-cost-basis-2024.0.2-linux.tar.gz.sha256` from a terminal).
3. Extract the the files from the `.tar.gz` or `.zip` archive, keeping the directory structure that is in the archive.

### Option 2: Build the App
See [How to Build the App](/../../wiki/How-to-Build-the-App) in the Wiki.

### Test the App
Test the app by running the app without any arguments from a terminal. For example,

```Shell
java -jar gold-trust-cost-basis-2024.0.2.jar
```

If the app was packaged properly for the system, the app displays the following message:

```
Usage: java -jar gold-trust-cost-basis.jar <gold-tax-data-file>
```

However, if the app fails with a message like

```
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.sun.star.comp.helper.Bootstrap
```

verify that the LibreOffice installation has a `libreoffice.jar` file.
If the file exists, then either the wrong distributable archive was installed or the app needs to be repackaged with the
correct absolute `file` URL of the `libreoffice.jar` file.
See the **Troubleshooting** section on the [How to Build the App](/../../wiki/How-to-Build-the-App) page in the Wiki.

## Running the App
When a consolidated 1099 PDF is passed to the app, the app will launch LibreOffice Calc and create the `tax-lots` and `cost-basis-factors` sheets.

**Linux example:**

```Shell
cd ~/Documents
java -jar ~/gold-trust-cost-basis-2024.0.2/gold-trust-cost-basis-2024.0.2.jar \
  2024-form-1099-consolidated.pdf
```

**Windows Command Prompt example:**

```Batchfile
cd %USERPROFILE%\Documents
java -jar %USERPROFILE%\gold-trust-cost-basis-2024.0.2\gold-trust-cost-basis-2024.0.2.jar ^
  2024-form-1099-consolidated.pdf
```

When a LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet with tax lot info is passed to the app, the app will launch LibreOffice Calc and add the `gold-sales` and `gold-cost-basis` sheets.

**Linux example:**

```Shell
cd ~/Documents
java -jar ~/gold-trust-cost-basis-2024.0.2/gold-trust-cost-basis-2024.0.2.jar \
  2024-spdr-gold-trust.ods
```

**Windows Command Prompt example:**

```Batchfile
cd %USERPROFILE%\Documents
java -jar %USERPROFILE%\gold-trust-cost-basis-2024.0.2\gold-trust-cost-basis-2024.0.2.jar ^
  2024-spdr-gold-trust.ods
```

If a tax lot was acquired in a prior year, the user will need to enter the tax lot's adjusted cost basis from the end of last year on the `gold-sales` sheet and refresh the pivot table on the `gold-cost-basis` sheet.

Note that the app does not save the spreadsheet. It is up to the user to decide whether or not to save the spreadsheet.
